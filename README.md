A game for [Ludum Dare](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/) 48-hour Game Compo number 32, "Unconventional Weapon" theme.
You can play it in your web browser [here](http://micah.cowan.name/anticon/).

Top-down shooter web game where you're swinging a ball around to hit your enemies. (Ball only does damage if it's moving at a decent speed.)

You can play on tablets, too! Tested with Firefox, Chrome and Safari on Mac, and on Samsung Tab 4 and iPad, too. Probably doesn't play well on MSIE.

Done in HTML5/JS. The only external JS library used is SoundJS, of the CreateJS library. Sound effects recorded and manipulated using Audacity, music loop banged out on Reason.

Originally, I wanted the "ball" to be your younger sibling, as the two of you making your way through an anime/comics/gaming cone ("Un-CONVENTION-al", heh), dodging vendors and cosplayers. But since I never had enough time to make "real" graphics instead of simple shapes, that's not really borne out in my results. Except for the gleeful giggling and squealing of the "ball" when you hurl it around quickly. :)

I spent a lot of time on the sound. If you don't hear the sounds, please try it in another browser, as it really adds quite a bit to the experience.
